# SOC-Automation-Lab
This project implements an automated Security Operations Center (SOC) workflow using on-premise VMs and open-source tools: Wazuh, The Hive, and Shuffle. It detects, analyzes, and responds to incidents like Mimikatz activity with minimal manual effort, enhancing SOC efficiency and streamlining operations.
